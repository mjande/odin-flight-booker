# Flight Booker

This app allows a user to find and book flights based on origin/destination and dates. This is a learning project created as part of the curriculum at [The Odin Project](theodinproject.com), and it is not connected to any external APIs (users cannot book real flights with this app). Project specs can be found at the project page found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flight-booker).

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
